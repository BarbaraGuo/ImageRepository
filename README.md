# ImageRepository
Image Repository Application for Shopify's Backend Challenge

# How to run 
Requires Python3 Installed

In the same directory as the script follow steps one and two outlined in https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/js#python-3.x

Because this program accesses drive it will require permissions. If a warning says the application is not verified appears, click advanced options to continue (I promise this won't destroy everything).

You may also have to run:

pip3 install --upgrade google-api-python-client

pip3 install  google-auth-oauthlib

Run: python3 imagerepository.py

# Comments

I chose python because it's the easiest language to run in my opinion and requires little set up. For this challenge I opted to store things in a text file rather than a legitimate database for similar reasons. Although I have written scripts that inject directly into SQL or cloud databases those would require more set up or money to sustain.
